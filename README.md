Distributed Erlang nodes in C++.

## Usage

tinch++ is a platform independent, open-source library for building distributed Erlang nodes in C++. Distributed Erlang nodes provide a high-level model for integrating other languages with Erlang programs. With tinch++, your C++ code will be able to communicate with Erlang processes by means of message passing. To the Erlang processes, your C++ node will look and behave like any Erlang node.

Usage examples and more information is given on [the project homepage](http://www.adamtornhill.com/code/tinchpp.htm).
